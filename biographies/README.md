# Biographies

A collection of biography book summaries covering influential lives, memoirs, and historical figures.

## Structure

- `biographies-books-list.md` - Master list with rotation tracking
- Individual book summary files

## How It Works

This repo uses a rotation system to track which book was last summarized. Each book gets a comprehensive markdown summary covering:

- Author background (of the biographer)
- Subject background
- Publication details
- TLDR summary
- Key takeaways
- Main themes and analysis

## Contributing

To add a new book:
1. Add to `biographies-books-list.md` with author and year
2. Create the summary markdown file
3. Update the rotation in the list file
