## Author Background

Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, renowned as a statesman, diplomat, inventor, scientist, and printer. Born in Boston to a candlemaker father, Franklin was the fifteenth of seventeen children. He received minimal formal education but was a voracious self-learner. Without inheriting wealth or connections, Franklin rose from modest origins to become one of the most influential figures in American history. He served as the first Postmaster General of the United States, helped draft the Declaration of Independence, and served as Ambassador to France. His scientific work, particularly the famous kite experiment demonstrating the electrical nature of lightning, earned him international fame. Franklin's practical wisdom, captured in his "Poor Richard's Almanack," made him a folk hero in colonial America.

## Book Summary

The Autobiography stands as one of the most influential memoirs ever written, offering a candid account of Franklin's remarkable journey from poverty to prominence. Franklin begins by recounting his family background and childhood in Boston, where his love of reading was fostered despite his limited formal education. He describes his apprenticeship to his brother James, a printer, and his early literary efforts, including his anonymous contributions to the New-England Courant under the pseudonym "Silence Dogood," a widow whose witty essays became hugely popular.

After a contentious relationship with his brother led Franklin to leave his apprenticeship, he made his famous journey to Philadelphia, arriving with little money and few prospects. Through determination and frugality, he established himself as a successful printer and publisher. The autobiography details his creation of the Junto, a club for mutual improvement that evolved into the Library Company of Philadelphia—the first lending library in America. Franklin's civic innovations included founding the American Philosophical Society, establishing Philadelphia's first fire department, and organizing the city's first paid police force.

The second half of the autobiography shifts to Franklin's later years, including his scientific pursuits and diplomatic career in France. Most famously, it details his "bold and arduous Project of arriving at moral Perfection," wherein he developed thirteen virtues—temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity, and humility—and created a system to track his daily progress. Franklin's honesty about his failures and limitations, including his strained relationship with his son William, adds depth and authenticity to this portrait of one of history's most remarkable figures.
