# Christian Books

A collection of Christian book summaries covering theology, spirituality, apologetics, and Christian living.

## Structure

- `christian-books-list.md` - Master list with rotation tracking
- Individual book summary files

## How It Works

This repo uses a rotation system to track which book was last summarized. Each book gets a comprehensive markdown summary covering:

- Author background
- Publication details
- TLDR summary
- Key takeaways
- Main themes and analysis

## Contributing

To add a new book:
1. Add to `christian-books-list.md` with author and year
2. Create the summary markdown file
3. Update the rotation in the list file
