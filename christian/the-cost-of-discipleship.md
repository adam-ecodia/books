# The Cost of Discipleship

**by Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1937)**

---

## Author Background

Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906–1945) was a German Lutheran pastor, neo-orthodox theologian, and anti-Nazi dissident who became a key founding member of the Confessing Church. Born in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland) into an intellectual family—his father was psychiatrist Karl Bonhoeffer and his mother Paula von Hase was a teacher—Bonhoeffer showed exceptional academic ability from a young age. He earned his Doctor of Theology degree from Humboldt University of Berlin at age 21, graduating summa cum laude.

After studying at the University of Tübingen and the University of Berlin, Bonhoeffer spent time in America at Union Theological Seminary in New York, where he was deeply influenced by the African American church in Harlem. This experience shaped his commitment to social justice and ecumenism. Upon returning to Germany in 1931, he became a lecturer at the University of Berlin and was ordained as a Lutheran pastor.

Bonhoeffer was a determined opponent of the Nazi regime from its earliest days. He opposed the Nazi euthanasia program and the persecution of Jews. He became involved in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler, was arrested in April 1943, and was hanged at Flossenbürg concentration camp on 9 April 1945, just weeks before the war ended.

## TLDR Summary

A classic Christian work that expounds on what it truly means to follow Jesus, using the Sermon on the Mount as its foundation. Bonhoeffer contrasts "cheap grace"—forgiveness without repentance and discipleship—with "costly grace"—grace that demands full surrender and obedience to Christ. Written in 1937 Nazi Germany, the book reflects Bonhoeffer's theology of costly discipleship, developed in the context of political and spiritual compromise.

## Book Summary

*The Cost of Discipleship* is centered on an exposition of the Sermon on the Mount, in which Bonhoeffer spells out what it truly means to follow Christ. The book was written in 1937 during the rise of the Nazi regime, and it was against this background that Bonhoeffer's theology of costly discipleship developed—a theology that ultimately cost him his life.

Bonhoeffer's central argument centers on the distinction between cheap and costly grace. Cheap grace, he argues, is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, communion without confession. It is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ living and incarnate. In contrast, costly grace confronts us as a gracious call to follow Jesus; it comes as a word of forgiveness to the broken spirit and the contrite heart, but it compels submission to the yoke of Christ.

The book argues that as Christianity spread and the Church became more secularized, accommodating the demands of obedience to Jesus to the requirements of society, the gospel was cheapened. While the monastic movement served as a protest against this cheapening, Bonhoeffer contends it became an individual achievement that the laity could not emulate, creating a double standard within the church. Martin Luther's Reformation brought Christianity "out of the cloister," but subsequent generations again cheapened the preaching of forgiveness.

Bonhoeffer emphasizes that true discipleship requires hearing and obeying Christ's commands, particularly from the Sermon on the Mount. Discipleship means taking up the cross daily, denying oneself, and following Jesus in concrete obedience. The book has been widely read by both conservative and liberal Christians and remains influential today.

## Chapter-by-Chapter Summary

### Part One: Grace

**Chapter 1: The Call to Discipleship**
- Discipleship is not a matter of optional commitment but of following Jesus wherever He leads
- The call is to "come and follow"—immediate and personal
- Discipleship means obedience to Christ's teaching, not just intellectual assent

**Chapter 2: Discipleship and the Cross**
- The cross is the mark of the true disciple
- Disciples must be prepared to suffer for their faith
- Worldly Christianity has made the cross optional, but true discipleship requires embracing it

**Chapter 3: The Saintly Cross**
- Suffering belongs to the Christian life
- We cannot separate the cross from discipleship
- The Christian life is not about avoiding suffering but about following Christ through it

**Chapter 4: The Message of the Cross**
- The cross is not a symbol of success but of failure in the world's eyes
- True Christians are those who take up their cross
- The message of the cross is foolishness to the world but is the power of God

### Part Two: The Sermon on the Mount

**Chapter 5: The Beatitudes**
- The Beatitudes describe the character of the disciple
- Poverty in spirit, mourning, meekness, hunger and thirst for righteousness, purity of heart, peacemaking, and persecution
- These are not optional ideals but the marks of true discipleship

**Chapter 6: The Antitheses**
- Jesus' "but I say to you" goes beyond external obedience to the heart
- Anger is murder in the heart; lust is adultery in the heart
- True righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees

**Chapter 7: The Lord's Prayer**
- Prayer is essential to the disciple's life
- The petition "thy will be done" means surrender to God's purposes
- Disciples pray in secret and trust God to provide

- True righteousness is between the believer and God
- The hidden life of prayer and obedience is the mark of true discipleship

## Theological Analysis

*The Cost of Discipleship* represents a significant contribution to Christian theology, particularly in its understanding of grace and discipleship. Bonhoeffer's critique of "cheap grace" addressed a problem he saw throughout church history—the tendency to separate forgiveness of sins from the call to obedience.

**Grace and Obedience:** Bonhoeffer argues that true grace always leads to obedience. Grace is not merely a metaphysical transaction but a transformative power that enables and demands following Christ. This stands against both legalism (salvation by works) and antinomianism (grace without obedience).

**The Sermon on the Mount:** Bonhoeffer takes the Sermon on the Mount seriously as a guide for Christian living, not as an impossible ideal. He argues that Jesus meant His words to be obeyed, not merely contemplated. The Beatitudes describe the actual character of disciples, not aspirational goals.

**Discipleship and Cost:** The book emphasizes that following Christ has a cost. Bonhoeffer wrote from experience—his context was Nazi Germany, where discipleship meant potential imprisonment and death. This gives the book an existential urgency that continues to challenge readers.

**Church and World:** Bonhoeffer addresses the relationship between the church and the world, arguing that the church cannot simply accommodate itself to cultural norms. The call to discipleship is counter-cultural.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cheap grace is a counterfeit:** Grace that requires nothing may not be grace at all. True grace transforms and demands obedience.

2. **Discipleship is costly:** Following Jesus means taking up our cross daily. This is not popular teaching but is central to Christian faith.

3. **Obedience matters:** Faith without works is dead. The Sermon on the Mount calls for actual obedience, not just intellectual agreement.

4. **The cross is essential:** There is no Christianity without the cross—both Christ's and the disciple's.

5. **Discipleship is immediate and personal:** Following Christ is not a gradual process but an immediate call to come and follow.

6. **The Beatitudes describe reality:** They are not aspirational ideals but marks of genuine discipleship.

7. **The hidden life matters:** Discipleship is primarily between the believer and God, not for public display.

## Overall Assessment

*The Cost of Discipleship* remains one of the most challenging and influential Christian books of the twentieth century. Its central insight—that grace without obedience is not grace at all—continues to provoke and inspire readers across denominational boundaries.

Bonhoeffer wrote from the crucible of Nazi Germany, and his words carry the weight of lived experience. He was not merely theorizing about discipleship; he was living it, ultimately giving his life for his faith. This gives the book a credibility that purely academic theological works lack.

The book's strength lies in its clarity and its willingness to take Jesus' teachings seriously. Bonhoeffer refuses to soften the demands of discipleship or to separate forgiveness from the call to follow. He challenges comfortable Christianity and calls readers to genuine transformation.

Potential criticisms include that the book can seem demanding and may be misused to legalism. However, Bonhoeffer's understanding of grace as transformative power—enabling the obedience it demands—protects against this. The cost of discipleship is not a legalistic burden but a response to the gracious call of Christ.

For anyone seeking to understand what it means to follow Jesus, or for those comfortable Christianity has left unsatisfied, *The Cost of Discipleship* offers a profound and challenging vision of the Christian life.
