## TLDR Summary

"The Master Plan of Evangelism" examines the methodology Jesus used to train His disciples and argues that effective evangelism must follow the same person-to-person, relational approach rather than relying on programs or mass evangelism. Coleman identifies eight key principles demonstrated in Jesus' interactions with His disciples.

## Book Summary

Robert Coleman's seminal work analyzes the evangelistic methodology of Jesus as recorded in the Gospels. The book's core thesis is that authentic evangelism is not about techniques, programs, or mass crusades, but about developing intentional, relational disciple-making relationships.

Coleman observed that Jesus invested deeply in a small group of disciples rather than trying to reach the masses directly. He selected 12 men, spent intimate time with them, modeled ministry before them, and gradually released them to do the work themselves. This "incarnational" approach prioritized quality over quantity in relationships.

The book identifies eight principles that characterized Jesus' disciple-making strategy: selection, association, concentration, demonstration, delegation, supervision, reproduction, and multiplication. Coleman argues that these principles are not optional suggestions but essential components of any effective evangelistic strategy.

## Chapter-by-Chapter Summary

1. **Preface & Introduction** - Sets up the thesis that Jesus' method is the master plan for evangelism
2. **The Problem** - Addresses why traditional evangelistic approaches often fail to produce lasting disciples

5. **Association** - Jesus lived with and modeled ministry for His disciples

## Theological Analysis

Coleman's theological framework centers on the incarnation model - God in Christ dwelling among humanity. This underscores the value of personal presence and relationship in evangelism. The book emphasizes that true evangelism is catching, not just teaching - disciples are made through life-on-life investment, not information transfer.

The book also reflects evangelical soteriology, emphasizing the Great Commission as mandatory for all believers, not just professional clergy. Coleman's approach aligns with Wesleyan understanding of entire sanctification through relational disciple-making.

## Key Takeaways

- Effective evangelism requires intentional, relational investment in a few rather than superficial contact with many
- Disciple-making is the method Jesus modeled - not crusades, programs, or entertainment
- Quality relationships produce lasting fruit; quantity-focused approaches often produce nominal Christians
- Delegation and reproduction are essential - leaders must empower others to do the work
- The goal is multiplication, not addition - each disciple should make disciples
- Ministry is caught more than taught - modeling matters more than manuals
- Jesus concentrated on 12, then narrowed to 3 (Peter, James, John) for intensive investment

## Key Quotes

> "The method is as important as the message."

> "The secret of reaching the world is not through mass evangelism, but through the multiplication of dedicated disciples."

## Overall Assessment

"The Master Plan of Evangelism" remains a foundational text in evangelical leadership training after 60 years. Its strength is its simplicity and biblical grounding - Coleman cuts through modern church growth strategies to rediscover the relational methodology of Jesus.

Critiques include that the book can feel idealistic for large churches, and some argue it undervalues other evangelistic methods. However, its core insight about relational disciple-making remains compelling and has shaped generations of church planters and evangelists.

The book is essential reading for anyone serious about making disciples, not just converts.
