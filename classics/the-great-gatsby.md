---

## Author Background

Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940), widely known as F. Scott Fitzgerald, was an American novelist, essayist, and short story writer. He is best known for his novels depicting the flamboyance and excess of the Jazz Age, a term that he popularized. Fitzgerald was born into a middle-class Catholic family in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and was raised primarily in New York state. He attended Princeton University but dropped out in 1917 to join the Army during World War I. While stationed in Alabama, he met Zelda Sayre, a Southern debutante whom he married in 1920. Fitzgerald achieved transient success and fortune in the 1920s but did not receive critical acclaim until after his death. He struggled with alcoholism throughout his life and died of a heart attack in Hollywood at age 44. He is now widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.

## Book Summary

The Great Gatsby is a 1925 tragedy novel set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City. The novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire obsessed with reuniting with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan. The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. 

Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's dust jacket art, named "Celestial Eyes," greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.

After its publication, The Great Gatsby received generally favorable reviews, though some literary critics believed it did not equal Fitzgerald's previous efforts. The novel is now widely considered to be a literary masterpiece and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel.

## Plot Outline

The novel is set in 1922, during the Prohibition era. Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate from the Midwest, moves to New York City to work as a bond salesman and rents a bungalow in West Egg, Long Island. Next door lives the enigmatic Jay Gatsby, who hosts extravagant parties but never partakes in them.

Nick visits his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan in East Egg (the more fashionable area). There he meets Jordan Baker, a golf champion and Daisy's friend. Jordan reveals that Tom is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the "valley of ashes" – a desolate area between the city and Long Island.

Nick receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's legendary parties. There, Gatsby recognizes Nick from the war (though they never met) and begins using Nick to arrange a reunion with Daisy. Gatsby and Daisy begin an affair, with Gatsby hoping his newfound wealth will win her back.

The affair culminates in a confrontation at the Plaza Hotel where Tom reveals Gatsby's criminal background (his fortune comes from bootlegging). Daisy, torn between Gatsby and Tom, ultimately chooses to stay with her husband. On the way home, Daisy – not Gatsby – strikes and kills Myrtle Wilson with Gatsby's car.

Gatsby plans to take the blame to protect Daisy. However, George Wilson, believing Gatsby was Myrtle's lover (as Tom had suggested), goes to Gatsby's mansion and shoots him dead before killing himself. Gatsby's funeral is sparsely attended, and Nick, disillusioned with the moral emptiness of the East Coast, returns to the Midwest.

## Literary Analysis

**The American Dream:** The Great Gatsby is perhaps the quintessential American novel about the corruption of the American Dream. Gatsby's rise from poverty to wealth represents the ideal of self-reinvention, but his dream is ultimately hollow – built on illegal activity and obsessed with a woman who is unworthy of his devotion. The novel suggests that the promise of the American Dream has been corrupted by materialism and social stratification.

**Social Class:** Fitzgerald meticulously delineates the class divisions between West Egg (new money), East Egg (old money), and the valley of ashes (the poor). Old money looks down on new money, while both disdain the working class. Gatsby, despite his wealth, can never truly enter East Egg society.

**Symbolism:** The novel is rich with symbolism – the green light at the end of Daisy's dock represents Gatsby's hopes and dreams; the valley of ashes represents the moral and social decay beneath the glittering surface; the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg represent God watching over America; and the color yellow symbolizes wealth and corruption.

**Narrative Technique:** The use of Nick Carraway as a somewhat unreliable narrator is masterfully executed. Nick is drawn into the world he observes and judges, making him both participant and observer.

**The Jazz Age:** Fitzgerald captures the hedonism, materialism, and moral permissiveness of the 1920s while simultaneously critiquing them. The novel serves as a social history of Prohibition-era America.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The corruption of ideals** – The American Dream, rather than enabling self-improvement, leads to moral decay and tragedy.

2. **The emptiness of materialism** – Wealth cannot buy happiness or love. Gatsby has everything except what he truly needs.

3. **The persistence of class divisions** – "Old money" never truly accepts "new money," no matter how wealthy one becomes.

4. **The danger of living in the past** – Gatsby's obsession with recreating his past with Daisy prevents him from living in the present.

5. **The observer's perspective** – Sometimes we see others more clearly than we see ourselves, and being an observer can protect us from moral contamination.

## Overall Assessment

The Great Gatsby is a masterpiece of American literature that has only grown in stature since its initial publication. While it received mixed reviews in 1925 and was a commercial disappointment, it is now considered one of the greatest American novels ever written. Fitzgerald's prose is elegant and precise, his characterization is nuanced, and his thematic exploration of the American Dream, class, and morality remains profoundly relevant. The novel serves both as a compelling love story and as a sharp critique of American society. Its enduring power lies in its ability to capture the beauty and tragedy of aspiration while exposing the hollowness at the heart of materialism. This is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand American literature and the American experience.
