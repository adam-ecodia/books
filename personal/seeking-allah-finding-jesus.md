Nabeel Asif Qureshi (April 13, 1983 – September 16, 2017) was a Pakistani-American evangelical Christian apologist.

He became a speaker for Ravi Zacharias International Ministries from 2013 until his death in 2017.

## TLDR Summary

A powerful memoir chronicling Nabeel Qureshi's journey from devout Ahmadi Muslim to Christian convert. Raised in a loving Muslim family and trained in Islamic apologetics, Qureshi engaged in years of scholarly debate with Christian apologist David Wood. Through careful examination of historical evidence, he concluded that Jesus is the Son of God who died for humanity's sins. The book details his painful transition, including the loss of most relationships with family and friends.

## Book Summary

### Part One: The Muslim Foundation

Qureshi begins by painting a picture of his upbringing in a devout Ahmadi Muslim household in San Diego. His father served in the U.S. Navy, and his parents "modeled love for others and love for country." From childhood, Qureshi was deeply committed to Islam, memorizing the Quran and studying Islamic apologetics.

He attended Old Dominion University, where he served as president of the Pre-Medical Honor Society. It was here that he met David Wood, a Christian apologist, and the two became friends despite their religious differences.

### Part Two: The Investigation

What began as friendly debates evolved into years of serious scholarly investigation. Wood challenged Qureshi to research Christianity and Islam with equal objectivity—a request that troubled Qureshi, who was content with his faith.

The heart of the book details the historical evidence each religion offers for its claims. Qureshi examines:

- **The reliability of scripture**: How reliably has the Bible and Quran been preserved?
- **The claims of Jesus**: Did Jesus really claim to be God? What about Muhammad?
- **The evidence for resurrection**: What historical proof exists for Jesus's death and resurrection?
- **The nature of God**: Can God be both transcendent and personal?

Qureshi was particularly struck by the historical evidence for Jesus's resurrection and the fulfilled prophecies of the Old Testament pointing to the Messiah.

### Part Three: The Conversion

The conversion itself was "the most painful thing [he] ever did." Qureshi describes the emotional and spiritual turmoil of leaving the faith of his parents, knowing it would cost him most of his relationships.

When he finally accepted Christianity, he lost friendships with fellow Muslims and faced the difficult task of telling his parents. The book movingly describes his father's response—not rejection, but a request that Nabeel continue seeking truth.

### Part Four: The Aftermath

Qureshi details the challenges of being a new Christian from a Muslim background. He discusses the persecution faced by ex-Muslims and the importance of loving others through the transition.

The book concludes with Qureshi's reflection on his journey and his commitment to sharing the gospel with Muslims worldwide.

## Key Themes

### Evidence-Based Faith

Unlike many conversion stories focused on emotions or experiences, Qureshi's journey was primarily intellectual. He was convinced by the historical evidence for Christianity, particularly the resurrection of Jesus.

### The Cost of Discipleship

Qureshi doesn't sugarcoat the pain of conversion. Leaving Islam meant losing most of his relationships and facing potential persecution.

### Respectful Dialogue

Throughout his investigations, Qureshi maintained respect for both religions. He encourages readers to engage in thoughtful, civil dialogue when examining faith claims.

### Fulfillment of Prophecy

Qureshi was particularly moved by messianic prophecies in the Old Testament that Jesus fulfilled—prophecies written centuries before Jesus's birth.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Historical evidence matters**: Qureshi converted based on scholarly investigation of historical facts, not emotional experiences

2. **The resurrection is central**: The historical evidence for Jesus's resurrection was the turning point in Qureshi's investigation

3. **Faith requires sacrifice**: True discipleship often comes with a cost—in Qureshi's case, losing most relationships

4. **Respectful dialogue is possible**: Intellectual disagreement doesn't require personal animosity

5. **Truth is worth pursuing**: Despite the pain it caused, Qureshi was grateful for the truth he found

6. **God uses skeptics**: God used an atheist (David Wood) to lead a devout Muslim to Christianity

## Key Quotes

> "I had been happy in my faith and with my Ahmadi community, and I did not want to leave it."

> "Converting to Christianity was the most painful thing I ever did."

> "As you consider my ministry, I hope it leaves a legacy of love, of peace, of truth, of caring for one another."

> "I was not looking for a new religion—I was looking for truth."

## Theological Analysis

### From Ahmadiyya Islam to Christianity

The Ahmadiyya movement believes in the prophethood of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, which mainstream Muslims consider heretical. Qureshi's journey thus involved not just leaving Islam but examining the very foundations of religious authority.

### The Question of Scripture

Qureshi examines how the Bible has been preserved over centuries through manuscript evidence, compared to the Quran's shorter textual history. He concludes that the Bible's transmission is more verifiable.

### The Nature of God

Islam emphasizes God's transcendence (tanzih) to the point of God's incomparability (tanzih). Christianity, while affirming God's holiness, also emphasizes God's immanence through Jesus Christ. Qureshi found the Christian understanding of a personal God more coherent.

## Conclusion

*Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus* is a compelling account of one man's intellectual and spiritual journey. It provides valuable insights for Christians seeking to understand Muslim backgrounds, for skeptics investigating faith claims, and for anyone interested in evidence-based belief.

Qureshi's story reminds us that faith can be both intellectually rigorous and deeply personal—that asking hard questions can lead to transformative truth.
